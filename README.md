Embroidery, crochet are my hobbies, so I thought of building a site for uploading my works. 

Looking forward to make it to 
- an e-Commerce site for order placement
- something like a social media platform just to share my work.  
- upload some tutorial videos. 

Wish me Good Luck! :)

I joined for MEARN full stack course, attending it offline and building my own sites from the lessons learned.
The site is static which uses just basic HTML5 and CSS3
