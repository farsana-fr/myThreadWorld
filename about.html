      <p>
        l found my hobby during the pandemic while l was working from home. My Big
        Thanks to my li'l sister for introducing me to the world of
        embroidery.After my first work, l fell in love with this art form. l
        started gifting the handmade things to my family and relatives. l got a
        great support and encouragement from my Family, especially my Mother with
        whom l share all the work progress.
      </p>
      <p>
        After few months l found yet another intersting art form called Crochet. l
        was a bit nervous to buy all that stuff before trying out a single crochet
        stitch in my life. Finally one day the idea of crocheting hit me and with
        encouragement from my Mom l bought a small hook to learn.After couple of
        days, learned the very basic single crochet stitch from YT tutorials. Now,
        finally l accured the courage to buy a new set of crochet hooks and yarn
        from MagicNeedles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, l want to extend my research in threads to Macrame works, made a
        keychain and plant hanger. Looking forward to explore more on Macrame.
